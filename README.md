- We add a text, button to enter the tasks of the to-do list at first.
- We assign the submitTask() function, which we will list the things to do later, to the button and call it create
- We are designing the edit and delete commands to the text-centers we have added.And 
- With the editTask() and deleteTask() functions, we can make changes and deletions in the to-do list.
